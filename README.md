<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p align="left">My name is VitÃ³ria Marca Santa Lucia and I'm a Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Brazil.</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">ðŸ“š I'm currently learning Python and some tools to work with data, such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.<br><br>I've done a web-GIS (Geographic Information System) using R in my final paper (to be a Geoprocessing Technician). It was a huge challenge because I didn't have experience with software development at all. However, I did it and proved to myself that I can do whatever I want to, I "just" have to learn (and I really love to learn new things). <br>With this experience, I realized how important mentors are in my life, especially when working with and studying tech. 
<p align="left">Now, at my undergraduate I want to continue challenging myself so that's why I'm a undergraduate researcher at ViTech (Video Technology Research Group). I am current working with coding process of omnidimensional videos with Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and how we can improve the coding process in time and memory efficiency .<br>
